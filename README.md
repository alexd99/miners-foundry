# Miner's Foundry

Welcome to **Miner's Foundry**, an engaging and relaxing idle game where you can purchase drills, mine iron, and smelt plates to upgrade your factory. Dive into the world of industrial management and watch your factory grow with your strategic decisions!

## Project Motivation

After years of working extensively with React and other modern JavaScript frameworks, I wanted to challenge myself with a return to basics by building a project with a mostly vanilla setup (vite, typescript, css, and html). This project is a testament to the simplicity and power of vanilla JavaScript and the fun that can be had with it.

## Game Features

- **Drill Purchase:** Acquire drills to increase your iron mining efficiency.
- **Smelting Plates:** Convert mined iron into plates to be used for factory upgrades.
